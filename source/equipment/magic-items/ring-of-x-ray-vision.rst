Ring of X-ray Vision
------------------------------------------------------


*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command
word. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1
minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects
within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from
passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch
of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances
block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.

Whenever you use the ring again before taking a
long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain
one level of exhaustion.

Robe of Eyes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you
gain the following benefits:

-  The robe lets you see in all directions, and you have advantage on
   Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

-  You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

-  You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see into the
   Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.

The eyes on the robe can't be closed or averted. Although you can close
or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while
wearing this robe.

A :ref:`srd:light` spell cast on the robe or a :ref:`srd:daylight` spell cast within 5
feet of the robe causes you to be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of
each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for
:ref:`srd:light` or DC 15 for :ref:`srd:daylight`), ending the blindness on a success.
