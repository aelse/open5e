Wand of Polymorph
------------------------------------------------------


*Wand, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 of its charges to cast the :ref:`srd:polymorph` spell (save DC 15) from
it.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes
and is destroyed.

Wand of Secrets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Wand, uncommon*

The wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 of its charges, and if a secret door or trap is within 30 feet
of you, the wand

pulses and points at the one nearest to you. The wand regains 1d3
expended charges daily at dawn.
