Dust of Sneezing and Choking
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It
appears to be *dust of disappearance*, and an :ref:`srd:identify` spell reveals
it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you
and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to
breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way
is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on it on a success. The *lesser restoration* spell can also end
the effect on a creature.

Dwarven Plate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Armor (plate), very rare*

While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, if an
effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can use your
reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.

Dwarven Thrower
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Weapon (warhammer), very rare (requires attunement by a dwarf)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a
long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this
weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8
damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your
hand.
