Oil of Slipperiness
------------------------------------------------------


*Potion, uncommon*

This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it
flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller
creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one
additional vial is required for each size category above Medium).
Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the
effect of a *freedom of movement* spell for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where
it covers a 10-Â­foot square, duplicating the effect of the :ref:`srd:grease`
spell in that area for 8 hours.

Pearl of Power
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its
command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot
was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you
use the pearl, it can't be used again until the next
dawn.
